  Errors in the application that have been resolved, perhaps you who came to look at this project may have the same errors
  1° FATAL: password authentication failed for user "postgres"
  This error happens when vs code with spring cannot authenticate to the database because there is a connection barrier in the (pg_hba.conf) -> file located in the postgree data folder on your computer
  Solution: Navigate to the bottom of the file in .txt mode and change the location or IP settings to | trust |

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     trust <-----
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust <-----
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust <-----
# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
local   replication     all                                     trust <-----
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            trust <-----
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 trust <-----

  Remove the arrows above, I only used them to highlight where the problem is

2° **APPLICATION FAILED TO START**
  
  Description:
  
  Web server failed to start. Port 8090 was already in use.
  
  Action:
  
  Identify and stop the process that's listening on port 8090 or configure this application to listen on another port.
  [22:25]

Solution: Open the .properties file in your editor and configure:
  
  server.port= {Another number other than the error}

1° FATAL: autentica??o do tipo password falhou para usu?rio "postgres "
  Esse erro acontece quando o vs code junto ao spring não consegue autenticar ao banco de dados por haver uma barreira de conexão no (pg_hba.conf) -> arquivo localizado na pasta data do postgree em seu computador
  Solução: Navegue até lá no fundo do arquivo em modo .txt e mude as configurações de local ou IP para | trust |
